# Reinforcement Learning for Robotics

Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a framework for robots to learn behaviors through interaction with their environment. This chapter covers RL techniques specifically adapted for robotics applications.

## Challenges in Robot RL

- Continuous state and action spaces
- Safety constraints
- Sample efficiency
- Reality gap (sim-to-real transfer)

## RL Algorithms for Robotics

- Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
- Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3)
- Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
