# Foundations of Robotics

Robotics forms the foundation of humanoid robotics and physical AI. This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts, components, and principles that underpin robotic systems.

## Components of a Robot

A typical robot consists of several key components:

- **Sensors**: For perceiving the environment
- **Actuators**: For physical interaction with the environment
- **Controllers**: For decision-making and control
- **Power systems**: For energy supply
- **Structural elements**: For physical form and stability

## Types of Robots

Robots can be classified based on various criteria including mobility, application, control method, and physical form.
