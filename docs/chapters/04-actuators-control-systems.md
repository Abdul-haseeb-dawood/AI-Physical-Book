# Actuators & Control Systems

Actuators enable robots to interact with their environment by converting energy into mechanical motion. Control systems coordinate these actuators to achieve desired behaviors.

## Types of Actuators

### Electric Actuators
- Servo motors
- Stepper motors
- Linear actuators

### Hydraulic and Pneumatic Actuators
- Advantages: High power-to-weight ratio
- Disadvantages: Complexity and maintenance

## Control Systems

### Open-Loop Control
Simple control without feedback

### Closed-Loop Control
Uses feedback to adjust actuator commands based on sensor readings
