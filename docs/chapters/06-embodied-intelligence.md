# Embodied Intelligence

Embodied intelligence refers to the idea that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment. This chapter explores how physical embodiment influences cognitive processes.

## The Embodiment Hypothesis

The theory suggests that intelligent behavior arises from the coupling between the body, brain, and environment. Physical form shapes cognitive capabilities and learning processes.

## Applications in Robotics

- Morphological computation
- Developmental robotics
- Evolutionary robotics
- Situated learning
