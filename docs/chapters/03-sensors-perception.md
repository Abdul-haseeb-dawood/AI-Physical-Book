# Sensors & Perception

Sensors are the eyes and ears of robotic systems, enabling them to perceive and understand their environment. Perception systems process sensor data to extract meaningful information.

## Types of Sensors

### Proprioceptive Sensors
- Encoders for joint position
- Force/torque sensors
- Accelerometers and gyroscopes

### Exteroceptive Sensors
- Cameras for vision
- LiDAR for distance measurement
- Ultrasonic sensors
- Tactile sensors

## Sensor Fusion

Sensor fusion combines data from multiple sensors to improve perception accuracy and robustness. Techniques include Kalman filtering, particle filtering, and deep learning approaches.
