# Sim2Real Transfer

Sim2Real (simulation to reality) transfer addresses the challenge of applying policies learned in simulation to real-world robots. This chapter explores techniques to bridge the reality gap.

## The Reality Gap Problem

Simulations are computationally efficient but inherently imperfect models of the real world. Policies learned in simulation often fail when applied directly to real robots.

## Transfer Techniques

- Domain randomization
- Domain adaptation
- System identification
- Robust control methods
- Simultaneous simulation and real-world training
